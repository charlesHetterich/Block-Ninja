#Block Ninja
######January 2014

Block Ninja was one of the small projects I made. It was inspired by Flappy Bird; I wanted to make a small phone-like game that was difficult. This project was helpful because it was good practice for creating something very quickly.

My goal from the beginning was to make it in 3 hours. After about 6 - 10 hours I decided to stop. I got up to adding menus which got boring for me so I stopped in the middle of adding the game over menu.
